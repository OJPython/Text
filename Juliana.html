    <h3>Sonnet 51</h3>
    <p>
        <pre>
            Thus can my love excuse the slow offence
        Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed:
        From where thou art why should I haste me thence?
        Till I return, of posting is no need.
        O! what excuse will my poor beast then find,
        When swift extremity can seem but slow?
        Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind,
        In winged speed no motion shall I know,
        Then can no horse with my desire keep pace.
        Therefore desire, (of perfect’st love being made)
        Shall neigh, no dull flesh, in his fiery race;
        But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade-
        Since from thee going, he went wilful-slow,
        Towards thee I’ll run, and give him leave to go.
        </pre>
    </p>
